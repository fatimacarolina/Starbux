# Dillinger
## Running
- You can easily run this program on your IDE by just running the MainApplication.java. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to set up docker to run it.
- The port it is hosted on is the default 8080

##Notes
- I didn't implement saving the cart as I had skipped that requirement while reading due to the speed.
- If I had more time I would have read more about security to figure out how to add roles for the Admin service. For now everyone needs to sign in as admin.
- I couldn't disable security for the tests, so there is something wrong with some of the tests. They should be written correctly as I tested them in another project with the same structure, but it seems the security is the issue.
